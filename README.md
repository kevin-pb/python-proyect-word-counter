# Architecture

The "collections" library is imported to use the "counter" method (we will use it later). The user is asked to enter a phrase and it is saved in a variable, the string is converted into a list and the "counter" method is used to check how many times each word is repeated in the passed phrase and the number of times each word is repeated is returned
